## Project 2 : Outside the Grid 

The Aim of this assignment was to Use a front-end framework to create an experimental responsive website. This project was initially generated using ChatGPT which provided the basic starting point and then used to develop the process.  

The ESCIn (escape-in) Design website is a simple two-page website that provides information on the latest interior design trends. The main focus of this website is to create a responsive website that can be used across various screens including a phone, tablet, and a desktop. The first page consits of a simple nav bar, hero section, a brief introduction to what interior design is and most importantly three images that are linked to the 'discover page'. A simple layout was adopted throughout the website for consistency and simplicity. The base code and content for this assignment was generated using ChatGPT, photos were taken from existing projects which helped to focus the attention on coding the website.
